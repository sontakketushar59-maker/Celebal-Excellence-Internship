-- Section D: Joins & Relationships

-- Q19: Orders + customer names
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.total_amount
FROM orders o INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- Q20: Left join customers + orders
SELECT c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, o.order_id, o.order_date
FROM customers c LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- Q21: Orders → items → products
SELECT o.order_id, p.product_name, oi.quantity, oi.unit_price, oi.discount_pct
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id;

-- Q22. Explain the difference between LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN with an example from this schema. When would you use a FULL OUTER JOIN?
/*LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the LEFT table + matching rows from the right. Non-matching right rows → NULL.
Example: All customers, even those without orders.

RIGHT JOIN: Returns all rows from the RIGHT table + matching rows from the left. Non-matching left rows → NULL.
Example: All orders, even if the customer record was deleted.

FULL OUTER JOIN: Returns all rows from both tables. Use when you need to see unmatched rows on both sides —
 e.g., customers without orders AND orders without matching customers (data quality check).*/

-- Q23. Identify all Foreign Key relationships in the schema. Explain what would happen if you tried to insert an order with customer_id = 999 (which doesn't exist in customers).
/*FK relationships:
• orders.customer_id → customers.customer_id
• order_items.order_id → orders.order_id
• order_items.product_id → products.product_id

What happens with customer_id = 999?
The database raises a foreign key constraint violation and rejects the INSERT. 
No customer with ID 999 exists in the customers table, so the reference would be invalid — this protects referential integrity.*/
